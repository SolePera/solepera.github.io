    <h1> ABOUT </h1>

Dr. Maria Soledad Pera is an Associate Professor at the <a href = "https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/"> Web Information Systems group</a>
 of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EWI), <a href = "https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a>. Sole's main area of expertise is in <a href = "https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/information-retrieval/"> Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems </a> with emphasis on non-traditional populations. Her current research work focuses on understanding the limitations and designing algorithmic support so that information access systems (search and recommender tools) can better serve all users (e.g., children) in different contexts (e.g., the classroom). 
<p>Since September of 2025, Sole serves as the <a href = "https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/dsait/msc-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-technology"> Director of Studies for the MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Technology </a> 
<p>
She was also recently named  (with George Neville-Neil) Co-Chair of the newly-instituted  <a href = "https://www.acm.org/articles/people-of-acm/2026/sole-pera">ACM Globalization Board</a>. 
<p>
    <p>
Sole is a co-PI in the ongoing SNSF-funded project <a href = "https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/10000973"> “Scaffolding to foster independence when children search Online for Learning” (SOL)</a>. 
<p>
    
Prior to joining TU Delft, Sole (a native of Argentina) completed Ph.D. in Computer Science at Brigham Young University in 2014. She joined the Computer Science Department at Boise State University as an Assistant Professor in 2014, where she was promoted to Associate Professor with Tenure in 2019. While at Boise State, Sole was  a co-PI in the NSF-funded project <a href = "https://cast.boisestate.edu/"> CAST (Child Adaptive Search Tool)</a>. She was the co-director of the <a href = "http://piret.info/">People and Information Research Team (Piret)</a> alongside  <a href = "https://md.ekstrandom.net/">Dr. Michael Ekstrand</a>. </p>
