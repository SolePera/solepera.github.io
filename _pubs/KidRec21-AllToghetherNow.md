## Abstract

In the classroom environment, search tools are the means for students to access Web resources. The perspectives of students, researchers, and industry practitioners lead the ongoing research debate in this area. In this article, we argue in favor of incorporating a new voice into this debate: teachers. We showcase the value of involving teachers in all aspects related to the design of search tools for the classroom; from the beginning till the end. Driven by our research experience designing, developing, and evaluating new tools to support children's information discovery in the classroom, we share insights on the role of the experts-in-the-loop, i.e., teachers who provide the connection between search tools and students. And yes, in our case, always involving a teacher as a research partner.
