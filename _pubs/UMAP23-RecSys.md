## Abstract

The aim of this work is to explore common traits preferred across different age groups of children to identify the appeal of book covers. By analyzing visual attributes, visible objects, and implied stories inferred from the covers, we can gain insights into the elements that are most attractive to children up to 18 years old. These findings can then contribute towards advancing personalization for recommender systems for children through new means that do not rely on historical data, seldom available for this user group.
