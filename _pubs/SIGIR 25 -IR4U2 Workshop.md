## Abstract  
The 2nd Workshop on Information Retrieval for Understudied Users (IR4U2) focuses on bringing user-centered AI perspectives to IR, emphasising accessibility and inclusion for user groups that are typically understudied in IR research. The workshop provides a forum to exchange ideas, identify research gaps, and promote work making information retrieval systems more inclusive and responsive to diverse user needs.
