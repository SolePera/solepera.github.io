## Abstract

Focused on children and the learning context, we argue for the importance of designing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that take a holistic view of their target users. Rather than prioritize system performance, these smart technologies can be tuned to assist users throughout the task completion process. We argue that considering children's diverse cultural, social, and emotional backgrounds is critical to pursuing inclusive and adaptive technologies that foster children's personalised learning and development.
