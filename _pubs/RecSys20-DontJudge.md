## Abstract

We summarize outcomes from KidRec 2020, the 4th edition of the workshop on International
and Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Children & Recommender and Information Retrieval
Systems; which this year was co-located with the ACM Interaction Design and Children
conference. In addition to lessons learned from the keynote address by Professor Marcia C.
Linn, accepted contributions, and collaborative work during the workshop, we offer insights
related to hosting KidRec as a virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic.
