## Abstract

During the past decade, recommender systems have rapidly become an indispensable element of websites, apps, and other platforms that seek to provide personalized interactions to their users. As recommendation technologies are applied to an ever-growing array of non-standard problems and scenarios, researchers and practitioners are also increasingly faced with challenges of dealing with greater variety and complexity in the inputs to those recommender systems. For example, there has been more reliance on fine-grained user signals as inputs rather than simple ratings or likes. Applications require more complex domain-specific constraints on inputs to the recommender systems. Likewise, the outputs of recommender systems are moving towards more complex composite items, such as package or sequence recommendations. This increasing complexity requires smarter recommender algorithms that can deal with this diversity in inputs and outputs. For the past four years, the ComplexRec workshop series has offered an interactive venue for discussing approaches to recommendation in complex scenarios that have no simple one-size-fits-all solution.
