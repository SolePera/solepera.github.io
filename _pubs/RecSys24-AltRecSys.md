## Abstract  
The AltRecSys workshop, held in conjunction with the 18th edition of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys ’24) in Bari, Italy, provides a platform for highlighting “alternative” work in recommender systems. Modeled after alt.chi and CRAFT sessions at FAccT, AltRecSys offers a space to discuss interesting, preliminary, off-beat, unexpected, and critical ideas in recommender systems that do not (yet) fit well into the kinds of publications and formats for the main conference or traditional workshops. This workshop is not a venue to showcase research advances. Instead, it is envisioned as a forum where researchers, industry practitioners, and other stakeholders exchange ideas and together identify areas of study and new questions to expand the discussions and research agendas of the RecSys community in future years.
