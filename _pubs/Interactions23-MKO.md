## Abstract

This forum provides a space to engage with the challenges of designing for intelligent algorithmic experiences. 
We invite articles that tackle the tensions between research and practice when integrating AI and UX design.
We welcome interdisciplinary debate, artful critique, forward-looking research, case studies of AI in practice, 
and speculative design explorations. â€” Juho Kim and Henriette Cramer, Editors.
