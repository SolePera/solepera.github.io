## Abstract

In this past year, the role of technology to support education has been more prominent than ever. This has prompted us to focus the 5th Edition of the International and Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Children & Recommender and Information Retrieval Systems (KidRec) around a major stakeholder when it comes to technology adoption for the classroom: the teacher. Much like in the previous editions of the workshop, our priority remains understanding what is good when it comes to information retrieval systems for children, this time from the perspectives of teachers. In order to control scope of our discussion and continue to advance knowledge in this area, we focus on technology that enables information discovery in the classroom context: search and recommendation systems. Expected outcomes from this workshop remain building community in this important area of work and extend the framework we have been defining to enable design and evaluation of good information retrieval systems for children.
