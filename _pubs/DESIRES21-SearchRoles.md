## Abstract

 In this paper, we examine the roles children play when using web search engines in the classroom context by revisiting, not replicating, a seminal work set in the home context. In particular, we describe how we juxtaposed performance indicators inferred from a combination of search logs (collected over two years) and expert grading of completed inquiry assignments to discern emerging search roles among children in primary four and five (aged 9 to 11). In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also explore differences when a traditional classroom is replaced by online instruction at home. Lastly, we discuss future research directions that we see as pivotal to advance research in Information Retrieval to and for children.
