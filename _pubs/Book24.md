## Abstract

In the current digital landscape, humans take center stage. This has caused a paradigm shift in the realm of intelligent technologies, prompting researchers and (industry) practitioners to reflect on the challenges and complexities involved in understanding the (potential) users of the technologies they develop. In this chapter, we provide an overview of human factors in user modeling, a core component of human-centered intelligent solutions. We discuss critical concepts, dimensions, and theories that inform the design of user models that are more attuned to human characteristics. Additionally, we emphasize the need for a comprehensive user model that simultaneously considers multiple factors to represent the intricacies of individualsâ€™ interests and behaviors. Such a holistic model can, in turn, shape the design of intelligent solutions that are better able to adapt and cater to a wide range of user groups.
