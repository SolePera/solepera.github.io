## Abstract

In this manuscript, we argue for the need to further look at search as learning (SAL) with children as the primary stakeholders. Inspired by how children learn and considering the classroom (regardless of the teaching modality) as a natural educational ecosystem, we posit that scaffolding is the tie that can simultaneously allow for learning to search while searching for learning. The main contribution of this work is a list of open challenges focused on the primary school classroom for the IR community to consider when setting up to explore and make progress on SAL research with and for children and beyond.
