## Abstract

In this work, we reason how focusing on Information Retrieval (IR) for children and involving them in participatory studies would benefit the IR community. The Child Computer Interaction (CCI) community has embraced the child as a protagonist as their main philosophy, regarding children as informants, co-designers, and evaluators, not just users. Leveraging prior literature, we posit that putting children in the centre of the IR world and giving them an active role could enable the IR community to break free from the preexisting bias derived from interpretations inferred from past use by adult users and the still dominant system-oriented approach. This shift would allow researchers to revisit complex foundational concepts that greatly influence the use of IR tools as part of socio-technical systems in different domains. In doing so, IR practitioners could provide more inclusive, and supportive information access experiences to children and other understudied user groups alike in different contexts.
