## Abstract

This year, the 21st edition of the Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop (DIR), was hosted by TU Delft. Following a series of online interactions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this edition returned to its traditional in-person format. In this report, we provide a summary of the program and discuss key insights and lessons learned gleaned from the event.
