## Abstract

This short review discusses the outcomes of the 3rd Workshop of the International and
Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Children & Recommender and Information Retrieval Systems (KidRec 2019), co-located with the 2019 ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC)
Conference, which took place June 12-15 in Boise, Idaho, USA. The goal for the workshop
was to explore the characteristics of a “good” information retrieval system for children. The
diversity of attendees – including industry representatives, undergraduate and graduate students, and senior scholars in various areas of computer science – made it possible to continue
to build community around this important topic and further discuss and outline the salient
concerns and the next steps to promote further exploration in this area
