## Abstract

In this vision paper, we spotlight children as often underserved users in the digital ecosystem. With online search as a use case, we discuss the need for a multi-perspective approach to designing interactive interfaces and technologies that can enable information access systems to better respond to children's requirements while respecting the cultural and social norms impacting their upbringing..
