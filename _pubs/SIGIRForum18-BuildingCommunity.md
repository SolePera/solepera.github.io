## Abstract

We present in this manuscript a report on KidRec 2017 workshop, the first edition of the international workshop on Children & Recommender Systems, co-located with the 11th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys) held in Como, Italy. While research focused on recommender systems is prolific and addresses issues pertaining to multiple domains-from music, restaurant, and movie recommendations to scholarly publications or news-little has been done to explore the constraints and limitations that existing strategies must face when applied to non-traditional stakeholders, such as children. The first edition of our workshop was aimed at providing a venue dedicated to building community in this area and identify future research paths to nurture and grow this emerging community.
