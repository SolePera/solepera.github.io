    My name is **Devan Karsann** and I’m a first year master’s student in Computer Science. Dr. Sole Pera is my advisor and next semester I’m looking forward to starting my graduate project. I have a data set available to use and soon it will soon be time to defend the project proposal! During the school year I work 30 hours a week at AppDetex, a software startup in downtown Boise. This gives me to take 6 credits a semester and I’m happy about the balance. Right now I’m taking Introduction to Information Retrieval and Large-Scale Data Analysis and they’re both cool classes. My personal website can be found at <http://www.devankarsann.com>.

    **Lawrence Spear** is a PhD student in Computer Science, working with Dr. Maria Soledad Pera. Before joining the PIReT Team, he had worked in industry for 20 years. Throughout his career, he has done R&D in the latest techniques in the industry whether it is more process oriented, such as Agile, Behavior Driven Development and Continuous Deployment; or more technical oriented, such as Machine Learning, Infrastructure as Code or .Net Core. His general research interest is information retrieval, such as how children discover new information and how different search engines have to handle non-Latin-based languages. He also has an intense passion for learning new knowledge and broadening his horizons.
