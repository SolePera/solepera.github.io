### Overview
This dataset includes an educational hierarchy structure of the form: grade-subject, subject-topic, and topic-term pairs. 

It is important to note that these pairs were created by extracting information from [Common Core State Standards](http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/), [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org/search-standards), and [Idaho Content Standards](http://www.sde.idaho.gov/academic/standards/).

In the hierarchy, "T_" denotes that the word / phrase is an educational topic, while "S_" indicates that it is a class subject. Topic words were also split into tokens and have the "T_" prefix as well.
