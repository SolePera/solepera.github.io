Popular search engines work best for a general audience. However, anyone who isn’t familiar or comfortable in a search environment — like children — can be excluded. Search literacy skills are critical skill for young searchers. Without it, their belief in their own ability to find answers, and their sense of curiosity, can suffer. The research agenda established for this area is focused on enhancing search engine functionality to enable the retrieval of resources presented to children so they better match their experience and vocabulary. We strive to desig and develop software modules that can interpret a child’s search intent, offer child friendly query suggestions, and provide suitable web results in response to queries written by children.
#This will remove the obstacles separating children from the resources they require, creating more successful searches and more successful students.
The implicit belief of this research is that the only prerequisite to a search should be curiosity.
